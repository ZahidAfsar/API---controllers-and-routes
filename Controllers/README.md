Day 1 - Today we are learning about Controllers and Routes

We are going to start by creating a Controller with Routes that Allow you to:

    1. Retrieves a list of students
    2. Add a Student
    3. Deletes a Student
    4. Edit a Student

Give our Endpoints different Routes

Pass data through Routes
